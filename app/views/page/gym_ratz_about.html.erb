				<strong>improve and develop</strong> their individual and team skills. Our goal is to assist each player to reach their personal potential and highest
				level of play, and to offer exposure needed to be <strong>recruited at the next level</strong>. Each player will participate in highly 
				competitive practices, league games, travel tournaments, and high school/college show case events against some 
				of the best teams on the East Coast.
