<h3>Our Training Philosophy</h3>
<p> 
	We provide various training clinics for motivated, dedicated players to reach higher levels of competitive play. 
	Each session we evaluate and advance individual understanding of the basketball work ethic, demonstrate specific aspects of key 
	player positions, build the confidence necessary for team competition, and reinforce "best practices" for rapid skill development.
